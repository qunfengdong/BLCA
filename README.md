Bayesian-based LCA taxonomic classification method
--------------------------------------------------
Bayesian LCA-based Taxonomic Classification Method (BLCA) is a Bayesian-based method that provides a solid probabilistic basis for evaluating the taxonomic assignments for the query sequences with bootstrap confidence scores, which is based on Bayesian posterior probability that quantitatively weigh each database hit sequence according to its similarity to the query sequence - the more similar database hit sequence to the query, the more its contribution to the taxonomic assignment of the query. 

We implemented the above algorithm as a simple python script here.

## Update
* **Sep 16 2019** Minor update of 2.blca_main.py to fix minus strand range from Blastn output (credit to [Carter Hoffman](mailto:hoffmanc@ohsu.edu)).
* **Jul 8 2019** Minor update of 2.blca_main.py to fix clustalo's compatibility issue with blast 2.9.0.
* **Jun 3 2019** Minor update of 2.blca_main.py to fix the hidden 100% confidence score bug.
* **May 9 2019** Minor update to 1.subset_db_gg.py to include a new function to extract only sequences with full taxonomy information.
* **Feb 26 2019 update** One utility script (generate_abundance_table.py) for merging multiple BLCA output is available in the utils folder.
* **Feb 21 2019 update** The entire package has been updated to python 3.
* **Nov 15 2018 update** Thanks to Kristjan's contribution, now we incorporated the use of clustalo as alignment software. Also, now BLCA main program is based on **python 3**.
* **May 11 2017 update** to be compatible for the latest blastn v2.5 and added a new parameter -j to limit the accepted hits number to 50. After another round of testing, we've decided to change the default value of coverage and identify filter to 0.80 and 90 respectively.

## Important Note -- Please do read
* BLCA has migrated to **Python 3**. If you'd like to use python2.7, please install from release (https://github.com/qunfengdong/BLCA/releases).
* BLCA currently is compatible with **blast 2.9.0+**, please make sure you have the latest blast: version 2.9.0 or above. 
* There should **NOT** be any "|" (pipe) present in the sequence ID of input fasta, database fasta and taxonomy files.

## Frequently asked questions

* What threshold should I use for the confidence score?<br>
0.8

* What should I do if I see "Error while loading shared libraries: ..." when running BLCA?<br>
This error is caused because your system lack the specified shared library. There are two things you can do:<br>
Ask your system administrator to install or provide access to the specified shared library. Then add its path to your $PATH, or copy it to your $PATH. (recommended) <br>
Or reinstall blca, make sure all modules and dependencies are installed correctly.

* What should I do if I see something like "ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence"?<br>
This error is caused because the format of your database is wrong. If you are using custom database, please refer to "Custom database" section for the correct format of the database files.

[A Bayesian Taxonomic Classification Method for 16S rRNA Gene Sequences with Improved Species-level Accuracy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28486927). *Xiang Gao; Huaiying Lin; Kashi Revanna; Qunfeng Dong* BMC Bioinformatics 2017 May 10;18(1):247.

## Install
To check out the source code, go to https://github.com/qunfengdong/BLCA. To obtain the scripts and example fasta files, do the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/qunfengdong/BLCA.git
```

After the github repository is cloned, you will find a folder named BLCA. All the scripts and example data files will be included in it. **It is highly recommended to run your own analysis inside this directory (BLCA), meaning you should have your fasta files moved to here, so you don't have to change the default database directory.**

## Quick start

We do not include a pre-compiled database with this release, so the first step is to build a taxonomy database from the NCBI 16S microbial database. We achieve this by using script _1.subset_db_acc.py_ (or 1.subset_db_gg.py). After the database is built and stored on your local machine, you will supply the location of the taxonomy output file (16SMicrobial.taxID.taxonomy) from the last step along with your input fasta file (test.fasta) to _2.blca_main.py_, then you will get a blca output as test.fasta.blca.out.

## Getting started
* To use the standard NCBI 16S microbial database, please go to Step 1.
* To use GreenGenes database, please go to Alternative Step 1.
* To use pre-compiled SILVA LSU database, please go to "SILVA LSU database".
* To use a custom database, please go to "Custom database".

### Step 1
* To compile, subset the 16S Microbial database. Please run:
```
$ python 1.subset_db_acc.py
```
More options available:
```
$ python 1.subset_db_acc.py -h

usage: 1.subset_db_acc.py [--dir DIR] [-d DATABASE] [--taxdmp TAXDMP]
                          [-h]

```
During the process of setting up the database, NCBI's 16S_ribosomal_RNA.tar.gz file, and taxdmp.zip will be downloaded into a default folder: ./db/, and uncompressed. 16S_ribosomal_RNA.ACC.taxonomy under the ./db directory is the taxonomy file should be supplied to the 2.blca_main.py as the database. 

### Alternative Step 1
* To format GreenGenes database, first you have to download the Greengenes fasta and taxonomy files from https://greengenes.secondgenome.com/?prefix=downloads/greengenes_database/gg_13_5/. The files you need are gg_13_5.fasta.gz and gg_13_5_taxonomy.txt.gz. After you make sure you download the targeted two files under BLCA folder, please run:
```
$ python 1.subset_db_gg.py
```
This script will unzip the downloaded files and create a new folder called "gg" to store all needed information.

More options available:
```
$ python 1.subset_db_gg.py -h
usage: 1.subset_db_gg.py [--dir DIR] [--ggfasta GGFASTA] [--ggtax GGTAX] [-t]

### SILVA LSU database (Credit to Dr. Daniel Swan)

Thanks to Dr. Swan's personal effort to build a BLCA-compatible blastn-database and taxonomy file for SILVA LSU database. 

* Download the pre-compiled database at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t0TzC08y7_LyglsdihaXu27oWr7PiKLe).

* After you've downloaded the SILVA LSU fasta and taxonomy file, you will need to format the fasta file as the following:

``` 
$ makeblastdb -in SILVA_132_LSURef_tax_silva_BLCAparsed.fasta -dbtype nucl -parse_seqids -out SILVA_132_LSURef_tax_silva_BLCAparsed.fasta
```
* Then you can follow the instructions in the [Training your own database](#training-your-own-database) section.

### Custom database

To use a custom database, a taxonomy file in the following format and a blastn database need to be generated.

1. Taxonomy file:
The format must be ID column + taxonomy column (in the format of "species:xxx;genus:xxx;...") separated by **tab**.
For the taxonomy column, the taxonomy rank must be present and followed by ":", and followed by the name of that taxonomy rank, and followed by ";".

```
NR_170391.1	species:Azospirillum ramasamyi;genus:Azospirillum;family:Azospirillaceae;order:Rhodospirillales;class:Alphaproteobacteria;phylum:Proteobacteria;superkingdom:Bacteria;
NR_170392.1	species:Erysipelothrix piscisicarius;genus:Erysipelothrix;family:Erysipelotrichaceae;order:Erysipelotrichales;class:Erysipelotrichia;phylum:Firmicutes;superkingdom:Bacteria;
NR_170393.1	species:Erysipelothrix piscisicarius;genus:Erysipelothrix;family:Erysipelotrichaceae;order:Erysipelotrichales;class:Erysipelotrichia;phylum:Firmicutes;superkingdom:Bacteria;
NR_170394.1	species:Erysipelothrix piscisicarius;genus:Erysipelothrix;family:Erysipelotrichaceae;order:Erysipelotrichales;class:Erysipelotrichia;phylum:Firmicutes;superkingdom:Bacteria;
NR_170395.1	species:Sphingorhabdus lacus;genus:Sphingorhabdus;family:Sphingomonadaceae;order:Sphingomonadales;class:Alphaproteobacteria;phylum:Proteobacteria;superkingdom:Bacteria;
```

2. Blastn database file:
This file can be generated by fasta file with record IDs the same as the taxonomy file. Use the following command:

``` 
$ makeblastdb -in <input_fasta> -parse_seqids -blastdb_version 5 -title "custom_db_title" -dbtype nucl
```
### Split input fasta (Optional)
* If you have a big fasta file, and you want to run BLCA in "parallel", you can use [this python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfasta/#command-line-interface) to split fasta sequences into multiple parts, then run BLCA on each individual part.

### Step 2 
Run your analysis with the compiled database. 

* For default database in default directory, please run:
``` 
$ python 2.blca_main.py -i test.fasta
```
* If you are running your analysis somewhere else other than in the BLCA directory, please do the following:
```
$ python /location/to/2.blca_main.py -i test.fasta -r /location/to/your/database/16S_ribosomal_RNA.ACC.taxonomy -q /location/to/your/database/16S_ribosomal_RNA
```
* If you are using the Greengene database as your reference, please do the following:
```
$ python /location/to/2.blca_main.py -i test.fasta -r gg/gg_13_5_taxonomy.taxonomy -q gg/gg_13_5
```
* If you are using custom database, please do the following:
```
$ python /location/to/2.blca_main.py -i test.fasta -r /location/to/your/database/your_taxonomy_file -q /location/to/your/database/database_name
```

More options are the following:
```
$ python 2.blca_main.py -h

usage: 2.blca_main.py -i FSA [-x] [-n NPER] [-j NSUB] [-d TOPPER] [-e ESET]
                      [-b BSET] [-c CVRSET] [--iset ISET] [-a ALIGN]
                      [-m MATCH] [-f MISMATCH] [-g NGAP] [-r TAX] [-q DB]
                      [-t GAP] [-o OUTFILE] [-p PROC] [-h]

## Output
* A text file with sequence id in the first column, and taxonomy annotation with confidence scores after each level of annotaion (superkingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species).
* Any reads that do not have a classification will be recorded as "Unclassified".
* There could be cases having the confidence score showing while there is no taxonomy assignment at genus/species level. It is due to the lack of taxonomy information in the database.

### Example output file:

## Training your own database

* BLCA main script 2.blca_main.py needs 
1. A BLAST formatted library from a fasta file containing sequences of your interest, using makeblastdb, as the following:
```
>NR_117221.1
AGTCGATCGATCGATCATCGCTCTCTAGAGAGAAAACCCGATCGATCGA...
>NR_144700.1
CGCGCGACGAGCAAGCGCAAACGGCAACGCGCGAAACCCGCGAGCGAGA...

$ makeblastdb -in YourDatabase.fasta -dbtype nucl -parse_seqids -out YourDatabase
```

2. A taxonomy file with two columns, sequence ID in fasta file, and its taxonomy from superkingdom to species in the following format (The deliminator between the sequence ID and taxonomy information should be a **tab [\t]**):
```
NR_117221.1     species:Mycobacterium arosiense;genus:Mycobacterium;family:Mycobacteriaceae;order:Corynebacteriales;class:Actinobacteria;phylum:Actinobacteria;superkingdom:Bacteria;
NR_144700.1     species:Virgibacillus massiliensis;genus:Virgibacillus;family:Bacillaceae;order:Bacillales;class:Bacilli;phylum:Firmicutes;superkingdom:Bacteria;
NR_108831.1     species:Bacillus endoradicis;genus:Bacillus;family:Bacillaceae;order:Bacillales;class:Bacilli;phylum:Firmicutes;superkingdom:Bacteria;
NR_113104.1     species:Prevotella enoeca;genus:Prevotella;family:Prevotellaceae;order:Bacteroidales;class:Bacteroidia;phylum:Bacteroidetes;superkingdom:Bacteria;
NR_027573.1     species:Intestinibacter bartlettii;genus:Intestinibacter;family:Peptostreptococcaceae;order:Clostridiales;class:Clostridia;phylum:Firmicutes;superkingdom:Bacteria;
```

3. Run 2.blca_main.py with the formatted database and taxonomy file.
```bash
$ python 2.blca_main.py -i test.fasta -r /location/to/your/database/YourDatabase.taxonomy -q /location/to/your/database/YourDatabase
